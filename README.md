### 📝 Random Forest Classifier for Activity Recognition
Welcome to the Activity Recognition project! This project leverages the power of Random Forest Classifier to predict activities based on labeled data, with evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance. 📊

---

### 🚀 Features
🔄 Preprocessing: Data normalization and splitting into training/testing sets.
🌲 Random Forest Classifier: A robust and efficient machine learning algorithm.
📈 Evaluation Metrics: Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance assessment.
📊 Visualization: Confusion matrix displayed using a heatmap for insights.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
-> Python 🐍
-> Scikit-learn: Machine learning modeling and evaluation.
-> Pandas: Data manipulation.
-> Seaborn: Data visualization.
-> Matplotlib: Plotting and graphing.

### ⚙️ How It Works
🗂 Load Dataset: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed by normalizing and splitting into training and testing sets.
🌲 Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier is trained using the training data.
🔍 Evaluation: The model predicts activities for the test set and is evaluated using metrics.
📊 Confusion Matrix: Results are visualized with a heatmap for better understanding.
📜 Results
🎯 Accuracy: Overall percentage of correct predictions.
🏆 Precision: How many selected items are relevant (weighted for multiclass).
🔍 Recall: How many relevant items are selected (weighted for multiclass).
🔗 F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
